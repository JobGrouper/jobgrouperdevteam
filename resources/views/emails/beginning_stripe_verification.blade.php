<h1>Beginning Verification</h1>
<p> Now that you've added a payment method to your account, we've gone ahead and started 
the verification process. We usually know in a couple of hours whether or not we'll require
more information from you, but occasionally it can take longer. We'll keep you informed on how
things are going.
</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any concerns. </p>
