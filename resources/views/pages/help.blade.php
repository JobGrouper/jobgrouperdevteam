                                <div class="text_block">JobGrouper is a subscription-based work marketplace, using a ‘group buy’ model similar to that

                                                        used by Groupon. For an example, let’s say an editor wants to make $63,000 per year. All she would

                                                        have to do is set her price at $35/month and require 150 buyers for her “unlimited editing” deal.

                                                        Once 150 buyers have been achieved, buyers will be charged $25/month, and their term papers,

                                                        resumes, and reports will look beautiful forever!</div>

                                <div class="text_block">There’s no catch! Let’s say you begin scouring the web for a math tutor, and wow, he costs

                                                        $60/hour! Convert that to the equivalent of a yearly full-time salary, and that’s $124,800/year!! Good

                                                        luck finding a full-time teacher who makes that much. So, why does our math tutor charge so much?

                                                        His rates are so high because he has to make up for the fact that his income is unstable, and he

                                                        doesn’t have anywhere near 40 hours worth of clients in given week.

                                                        JobGrouper, in contrast, gives workers stability by providing them with enough aggregated gigs to be

                                                        equivalent to a full-time job, and the security of knowing that buyers are committing to a monthly
